/*

POSITION property allows us to position elements. 

Flujo de renderizado / Rendering flow: as a general rule, elements are drawn from left to right and top to bottom. Point 0,0 of the elements, as a general rule, is the top left corner.

Reserved space / espacio reservado: space that an element has assigned in the browser.

Positioned element / elemento posicionado: the element has the property position with a value different than "static", which is the value that this property has by default.

Stacking context / contexto de apilamiento: order in which overlapping boxes will be stacked.

When positioning an element, 5 properties are enabled that we can use to move the elements in the 3 axes:

    top -> the element will move from the top the distance that we have indicated.

    right -> the element will move from the right the distance that we have indicated.

    bottom -> the element will move from the bottom the distance that we have indicated.

    left -> the element will move from the left the distance that we have indicated.

    z-index -> allows to move the element in the stacking context (Z axis).

    NOTE: if we declare the property top and/or left for an element, property bottom and/or right won't work.

Possible values for POSITION:

    static -> default value
